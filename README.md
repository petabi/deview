# Deview

Deview (Dioxus + REview) is Petabi's internal tool designed to enhance the
development and testing process for REview, our central management server to
collect and analyze events. This project creates a modern, efficient web
interface using Dioxus with server-side rendering (SSR) to interact with REview.

## Project Goals

1. **Improve Internal Testing**: Provide our team with a dedicated tool to test
   REview's functionality without having to set up a full REview instance.
2. **Showcase Modern Web Technologies**: Demonstrate the benefits of using
   Dioxus and SSR over the current client-side rendering approach used in the
   official REview UI.
3. **Enhance Performance**: Leverage Dioxus and SSR to significantly reduce
   initial load times and improve overall application responsiveness.
4. **Support Cloud Deployments**: Prepare REview for cloud-based deployments by
   addressing potential performance bottlenecks and improving scalability.
